- Acquired using a comprehensive, hardware-synchronized sensor suite mounted on a mini-cheetah-legged robot. The suite includes an event stereo camera, a conventional stereo camera, an RGB-D sensor, a LiDAR, IMU, and joint angle sensors.

- Encompassing a broad range of motion dynamics, environmental complexities, illumination conditions, and control algorithms.

- Providing accurate ground truth indoor pose information.
