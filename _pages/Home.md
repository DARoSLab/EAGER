- We present the first dataset that provides a comprehensive collection of sensor data from an agile quadruped robot, including inputs from an event camera, RGB-D camera, IMU, LiDAR, and joint encoders.

- We provide data across 31 distinct environments, within each of which we captured data under varying lighting conditions and through diverse robotic locomotion gaits.
- We offer 6 DoF ground-truth poses from a motion capture system or an advanced SLAM algorithm, complemented with precise intrinsic, extrinsic, and temporal synchronization parameters.
